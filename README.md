# chia-nft-minting-helper
a bash script to help make the process of minting a series of NFTs on the Chia Blockchain easier.

This is what I used for my NFT collection, and you are free to adapt it to your own uses. To do so, go through the script and change any relevant variables. Also edit the metadata file found in /metadata. This is not production-ready software by any means, so please use at your own risk. I welcome anyone working on this to improve it. This is the first bash script I've ever written. 

I tried to create a Python script to upload the images via the command line, but I couldn't figure out how to get it work. Feel free to take a look at it and fix it if you know how. Pull requests / forking encouraged. 

I also want to create another script to create the offer files and upload them to Dexie, but that is TBD.

Happy minting!
